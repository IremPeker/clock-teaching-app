## Project title

Clock Teaching App

## Tech/library used

This project was built by using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).

## Installation

Install the node modules with `npm install`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

See the section about [tests](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for the production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

See the section about [creating a production build](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/production-build/) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.<br>

See the section about [npm run eject](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/available-scripts/#npm-run-eject) for more information.<br>

## How to use?

After you start the project in localhost, you will see an analog clock. There are 2 input fields. The first field is for 12 hours format, the second is for 24 hours format. Write the inputs and click on Uberprufen. If you want to get a new time, click on Neue Uhrzeit.

Note that the minute will only show the numbers that can be divided by 5. This will change later when kids learn to read all the minutes :)
